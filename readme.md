# 🔐 Backend Components Learning Series

## 👋 Welcome
This repository is part of my **self-learning series** where I explore and explain different backend technologies and authentication methods.  

The idea is simple: instead of jumping straight into a big project, I break down **small but powerful components** that can be learned and practiced individually.

---

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here
Each folder in this repo focuses on **one concept** with **code examples + explanation**:

- **Session-Based Authentication** → Storing user sessions with `express-session` (Implemented)
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** → Stateless authentication with signed tokens  
- **Redis Integration** → Using Redis for caching and session management  
- **Docker Setup** → Containerizing backend services for easy development  
- **Other Backend Building Blocks** → Small components you can reuse in bigger projects  

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo?
- Learn **step by step** instead of getting lost in a huge codebase  
- Each module is **self-contained** → you can practice independently  
- Covers both **theory (why use this)** and **code (how to implement it)**  
- Aimed at **beginners and intermediate devs** who want to strengthen backend fundamentals  

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swastik2740S/Backend_components.git

2. Navigate to any module (e.g., JWT auth):
   ```bash
   cd jwt-auth

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   npm start

👉 Each folder has its own README explaining the concept and code.

# 📖 How to Learn From This
- Pick one topic (e.g., session-auth)
- Read the explanation in the folder
- Run the code locally
- Experiment by tweaking values and adding features
- Move to the next topic when you’re confident 🚀

# 🤝 Contributions
- This is mainly my learning journal, but if you find mistakes or want to add improvements, feel free to:

# 📌 Roadmap
- ✔️ Session-based authentication
- ✔️ JWT authentication
- ✔️ Redis basics
- ✔️ Docker for backend
- 🔲 Combine all into a mini-project
